Hello!


The idea of this article is that you solve the following problem using what you have learned.
At work, you have a request to create a couple of containers. Find the details below:

- A container with the Apache + php image created in the previous exercise with:
* 50Mb RAM limits
* You can only access the CPU 0
* It must have two environment variables:
    - ENV = dev
    - VIRTUALIZATION = docker
* The webserver must be accessible via port 5555 in the browser

Solution: docker run -d -p 5555:80 --name limited-container -m "50mb" --cpuset-cpus 0 -e "ENV=dev" -e "VIRTUALIZATION=docker" challenge-two:v1

- A container with the Apache + php image created in the previous application with:
* 100Mb RAM limits
* You can access CPU 0 and 1
* You must have three environment variables:
    - ENV = stg
    - VIRTUALIZATION = docker
    - TYPE = container
* The webserver must be accessible via port 8181 in the browser

You should check its operation by entering your localhost: 5555 and localhost: 8181
Have fun!

Solution: docker run -d -p 8181:80 --name limited-container-2 -m "100mb" --cpuset-cpus 0-1 -e "ENV=stg" -e "VIRTUALIZATION=docker" -e "TYPE=container" challenge-two:v1
