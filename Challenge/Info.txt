Check your knowledge!
Hello!

The idea of this article is that you solve the following problem using what you have learned.
At work, you have a request to create a basic Docker image which will be taken as a base for 
all of the webapps. Your task is to create a Dockerfile with the following specifications 
and deliver it to your boss:

Operating System Base:  Debian



Tools to install:
   - Apache (Latest version)
   - PHP 7.4

You must use best practices.
You should check  that the image works by creating an index.php with the phpinfo function.
Have fun!
